open-url-dialog.lua
====================

**open-url-dialog.lua** is a script for mpv that can launch a text dialog to allow for easy opening of URLs, such as YouTube links (default: Ctrl+Shift+O.) It is a fork of [open-file-dialog](https://github.com/rossy/mpv-open-file-dialog). :sparkles:

This script requires PowerShell. It should work on all Windows versions that mpv supports.
